# Project Description

## Overview
This project is a web application built with React and Tailwind CSS as part of the GEMS (Grow, Engage, Master, and Succeed) program of IEEE Region 10 Young Professionals. The application allows users to create and submit a contact form and showcases the use of modern web development technologies.

## Features
1. **Navbar**: The navbar component is included at the top of the page and provides navigation links to different sections of the website.

2. **Contact Form**: The contact form component allows users to enter their name, email, phone number, and description. The form includes input validation and handles form submission.

3. **Footer**: The footer component is displayed at the bottom of the page and contains information about the website or organization, such as contact details or social media links.

## Technologies Used
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building responsive designs.
- React Icons: A library that provides a set of customizable icons for React applications.

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory using the command line.
3. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
4. Run `npm run start` to start the development server.
5. Open a web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.


## Responsive Design
The web application is designed to be completely responsive, ensuring optimal user experience across different devices and screen sizes. The use of Tailwind CSS, a responsive CSS framework, facilitates the creation of a responsive layout by providing pre-defined utility classes for handling various screen sizes. This allows the components and content to adapt and adjust dynamically to different devices, ensuring that the website remains accessible and visually appealing on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

This web application is developed as part of the GEMS program under IEEE Region 10 Young Professionals. It demonstrates the practical application of React and Tailwind CSS for creating a responsive and user-friendly contact form. The project, with its responsive design and use of modern web development technologies, serves as a valuable learning resource and can be further customized and expanded upon to meet specific requirements and design preferences.
